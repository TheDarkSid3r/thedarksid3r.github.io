        <div class="title">What do I do?</div>
        <div class="body">For Jackbox, I generally used to just have a fun time modding basic code and sprites for
            enjoyment, but lately I've been working on some more useful utility mods. I've just recently wanted to
            <i>help</i> more. With KTaNE, I started out modding when a Discord friend asked me if I could make a module
            for KTaNE. I didn't have any experience modding the game, but after many hours I was able to make my first
            module. After that, I made another couple of modules, but then kind of forgot about the game for a while.
            Eventually, I came back, and realized I could make utility mods for KTaNE too. The majority of my most
            recent mods are utility mods or just other stuff that isn't modules.

My name is TheDarkSid3r, but most people call me Dark. It's your choice. I'm part of the fanbase for Jackbox Games and Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and those are two games that I frequently mod and edit.

I'll be listing some of my projects and posting semi-frequent updates for them on this blog.
